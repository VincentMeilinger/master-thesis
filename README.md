# Master Thesis on Author Disambiguation (AND) on public domain Knowledge Graphs
This repository contains the code and the data used for the experiments in the master thesis on AND on public domain Knowledge Graphs.

## Research Questions
The research questions addressed in this thesis are:

**Primary Research Questions:**
- How can Graph Learning methods be effectively used on public domain publication knowledge graphs to disambiguate author names?
  - Can Graph Attention Networks (GAT) be used to generate embeddings for the nodes in the knowledge graph? 
  - What learning methods can be used to generate graph embeddings that encode the structure of the knowledge graph?
**Secondary Research Questions:**
- Can Link Prediction be used to enhance AND performance?
  - Is Relational Learning viable to improve the performance entity resolution?
  - What is the effect of incorporating prior knowledge in the form of knowledge graph links into the AND process?

## Graph Embedding
A Graph Attention Network (GAT) is used to generate embeddings for the nodes in the knowledge graph that encode the structure of the graph.


## Pipeline

**TODO:** This section will be updated when the pipeline design is finalized.
